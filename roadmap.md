# SystemBus Implementation Roadmap

This document outlines the phased approach for implementing the SystemBus package, from core functionality to advanced features.

## Phase 1: Core Messaging Infrastructure

- [x] Define `BusVerb` enum (get, post, put, delete, patch, options)
- [x] Implement `BusPacket` class with:
  - [x] Version field (hardcoded to 1)
  - [x] Verb, URI, payload, and responsePort fields
  - [x] Response-specific fields (isResponse, success, result, errorMessage)
  - [x] Serialization methods (toMap, fromMap)
  - [x] Factory constructors for requests and responses
- [x] Implement basic `SystemBus` class:
  - [x] Constructor that creates an internal ReceivePort
  - [x] SendPort getter for sharing with peers
  - [x] Message handling logic
  - [x] URI-based routing mechanism
  - [x] `bindListener(host, port)` method returning a Stream<BusPacket>
- [x] Implement essential tests:
  - [x] HttpVerb enum tests
  - [x] BusPacket serialization/deserialization tests
  - [x] SystemBus basic routing tests
  - [x] Custom verb enum support tests

## Phase 2: Client API and Error Handling

- [x] Implement `SystemBusClient` class:
  - [x] Constructor accepting a SendPort
  - [x] Verb-specific methods (get, post, put, delete, patch)
  - [x] Internal request/response handling
  - [x] Future-based API
- [x] Add error handling:
  - [x] Timeout mechanism for requests
  - [x] Error propagation through Futures
  - [x] Validation of packet structure
- [x] Add logging infrastructure:
  - [x] Configurable log levels
  - [x] Message tracing for debugging
- [x] Implement essential tests:
  - [x] SystemBusClient functionality tests
  - [x] Error handling tests
  - [x] Timeout tests
  - [x] HttpSystemBusClient tests

## Phase 3: Advanced Routing and Patterns

- [ ] Enhance routing capabilities:
  - [ ] Path-based routing (similar to HTTP routers)
  - [ ] Query parameter support
  - [ ] Route parameter extraction
- [ ] Implement additional communication patterns:
  - [ ] Pub/Sub pattern (publish/subscribe)
  - [ ] Signal broadcasting (one-way notifications)
  - [ ] Bi-directional channels

## Phase 4: Performance and Utilities

- [ ] Performance optimizations:
  - [ ] Message batching for high-frequency communications
  - [ ] Efficient serialization for large payloads
- [ ] Add utility features:
  - [ ] Message filtering middleware
  - [ ] Rate limiting
  - [ ] Circuit breaker pattern
- [ ] Implement monitoring:
  - [ ] Message metrics (counts, latencies)
  - [ ] Health checks
  - [ ] Debugging tools

## Phase 5: Documentation and Examples

- [ ] Complete API documentation:
  - [ ] Class and method documentation
  - [ ] Parameter descriptions
  - [ ] Usage examples
- [ ] Create example applications:
  - [ ] Basic request/response example
  - [ ] Pub/Sub example
  - [ ] Multi-component application example
- [ ] Write tutorials:
  - [ ] Getting started guide
  - [ ] Best practices
  - [ ] Advanced usage patterns

## Phase 6: Testing and Stability

- [ ] Comprehensive test suite:
  - [ ] Unit tests for all components
  - [ ] Integration tests for common scenarios
  - [ ] Performance benchmarks
- [ ] Edge case handling:
  - [ ] Network interruptions
  - [ ] Resource cleanup
  - [ ] Memory leak prevention
- [ ] Compatibility testing:
  - [ ] Different Dart versions
  - [ ] Flutter compatibility
  - [ ] Web platform support (if applicable)

## Future Considerations

- [ ] Cross-isolate communication patterns
- [ ] Network transport adapters (WebSocket, HTTP, etc.)
- [ ] Security features (authentication, encryption)
- [ ] Schema validation for messages
- [ ] Code generation for type-safe clients
